A Udacity FEND project "Feed Reader Testing". The purpose of this project is to complete tests using a Jasmine's testing syntax. There's a 'todo' lists in the 'feedreader.js' file found in the 'jasmine' folder, where the tasks are completed.

## Installation

### Node.js and npm

There are a couple of ways to run the jasmine browser. I chose through 'Node.js'. Node.js and 'npm' should be installed before-hand.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
NOTE: When you install Node.js, npm is automatically installed too. Therefore, just ignore the link to download 'npm'.

### jasmine

Next, you would install the JavaScript Unit Testing Framework 'jasmine', however, it is already installed locally in the folder. Therefore it is unnecessary to install jasmine again via terminal.

## Opening up the file

To see the RSS Feed within the jasmine browser, open up the 'index.html' file.
